# messaging-with-mass-transit-introduction
This is a set of examples on how to use the .NET messaging framework MassTransit.

What is MassTransit? It is an open-source .NET service bus. It is an ideal choice to connect the various parts in a distributed architecture for easy communication between them.
More information here: http://masstransit-project.com/

The example code is fully documented on my blog in a series dedicated to MassTransit. 

The first instalment is available here:

There's a link to each subsequent part at the end of the posts.
